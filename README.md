# Multi-Step Form with React

## Description

This project is a multi-step form application built with React.js. The form includes three steps:

1. **Step 1: Personal Information** - Collects the user's name, email, and phone number.
2. **Step 2: Address Information** - Collects address details such as address lines, city, state, and zip code.
3. **Step 3: Confirmation** - Allows users to review all the information entered.

The form features client-side validation, error handling, responsive design, and local storage persistence. Navigation between steps is managed with smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Multi-Step Form**: Sequential form with three steps.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled and valid before proceeding.
- **Local Storage**: Persist data across form steps and pre-fill fields if revisited.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animations between steps for a polished user experience.
